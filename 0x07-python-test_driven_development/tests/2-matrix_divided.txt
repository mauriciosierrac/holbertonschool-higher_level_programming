===============================
How use matrix_divided Function
===============================

Usage
-----

Import the function:

	>>> matrix_divided = __import__('2-matrix_divided').matrix_divided
	>>> matrix = [[1 , 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
Test for Success cases:

Test for integer number.

	>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 3)
	[[0.33, 0.67, 1.0], [1.33, 1.67, 2.0]]

Test for a Negative integer.

	>>> matrix_divided(matrix, -3)
	[[-0.33, -0.67, -1.0], [-1.33, -1.67, -2.0]]

Test for float Numbers

	>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 2.1)
	[[0.48, 0.95, 1.43], [1.9, 2.38, 2.86]]

Test fot negative float

	>>> matrix_divided(matrix, -2.1)
	[[-0.48, -0.95, -1.43], [-1.9, -2.38, -2.86]]

Test for empty matrix
	>>> matrix = [[]]
	[[]]

Test for matrix 4 x 4.

	>>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3, 4], [4, 5, 6, 6]]
	>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 3)
	[[0.33, 0.67, 1.0, 1.33], [1.33, 1.67, 2.0, 2.0]]
